15.Generate ssh keys using command
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
And save it using enter enter button now your key will Generate
you can see this message
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/Shree/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Created directory '/c/Users/Shree/.ssh'.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/Shree/.ssh/id_rsa
    Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/Shree/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:0PM1rpWjZvvBK8oumqFQFQqyj8zuWwKriFGQpVCWQxE ashiravadtidake.com
    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 4096]----+
    |+oE+.            |
    |oBo. . .         |
    |= ... . o   o    |
    |o+ .   . o o o   |
    |oo+     S . =    |
    |o+         = .   |
    |+o ..     = o    |
    |=oo. o.. o.. o   |
    |+oo o. o+..oo    |
    +----[SHA256]-----+
16. Now coppy this path from this message  'Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/Shree/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'
and paste in the following command
    cat /c/Users/Shree/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    like this...
    Now you will see the whole ssh key now coppy this whole key and add in the section of key in github
    and generate key using step 14.
17. Now again send push request use following command
    git push origin master
Now it will successfully push your project at your repository. and you can see the reflected changes at your repository.
